# Creditcoin CLI

## Development

### Build

To build the project, run the following command from the root directory:

```shell
yarn install && yarn build
```

### Updating Type definitions

Creditcoin-JS uses actual chain metadata to generate the API types and augmented endpoints. When the Creditcoin blockchain gets updated and includes new extrinsics or storage fields in it’s pallets, Creditcoin-JS must regenerate its types to include the newly available methods.

1. Fetch Chain Metadata

This process begins with pulling the current metadata from a running `creditcoin-node` by making an RPC call. You can use the `get-metadata.sh` script to do this. It will save the metadata to a file called `creditcoin.json`.

```shell
./get-metadata.sh
```

2. Generate Types

The types can be generated by running the following command:

```shell
yarn build:types
```

### Get balance example

```shell
node dist/cli.js balance --substrate-address 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```
